## How do I use this?
1. Download this repository as a zip file ⬇️
2. Open it up as a working directory in Visual Studio Code
3. Create a new repository in your Github account, navigate to your working directory and push it to your new repo (copy the quick guide from your new repo in Github where it says "…or create a new repository on the command line")
4. Work in groups to solve the problems using a branch for each challenge e.g. first_reverse_challenge
5. Make sure you and your team members understand what has been done before each of you commits the code your individual repos

## Have fun!
